Hey there, anybody who might actually read this eventually.  I've been
thinking lately
about the features that I've proposed for awflwm.  There are a few
issues with integrating
guile for anything more than using it as a simple configuration
scheme.  For this reason,
I'm thinking about nixing guile support, since it's derned near
infinitely easier to just parse
a text file.

Anything that anybody would like to see in this thing?

Scruff
